My first project in Swift during summer break of 2022.

Basic offline shopping list app designed for iOS devices. App supports two main modes - simple mode (basic shopping list) and shop mode (shopping lists for each shop). The main premise is to ease the process of coupon hunting in many different shops and making keeping track of bought items effortless.

## Features
* Loading screen
* Home screen
* Settings screen

### Two modes of usage:
* **Simple mode:**
    * Adding and deleting items
    * Marking items as bought
    * Editing items
* **Shops mode:**
    * Adding and deleting shops from database
    * Appropiate shop theme support
    * Managing each shop's shopping list similarly to **Simple mode**
